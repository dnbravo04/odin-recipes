    <p>The merengón is not really a Colombian dessert because it truly is a pavlova, a dessert that was created in
        either Australia or New Zealand, but it’s so popular, that many people in Colombia really believe it’s
        Colombian. In many homes they make it in two big layers which they later divide into portions before serving.
        However, in many sweet shops or bakeries, they make them into individual portions and serve them with all kinds
        of fruit like soursop, blackberries, strawberries, peaches, mango, whatever they have on hand.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the merengue cookie</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cream of tartar or lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 cup (200 g) white granulated sugar, pulverized in the blender</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla essence</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Merengón</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups whipped cream</li>
            <li>3 cups fruit of your choice (strawberries, kiwis, peaches, mangos, soursop, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>For the merengue cookie</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat oven at 250ºF (120ºC).</li>
            <li>Clean your bowl and whisk with a paper towel soaked in vinegar. This will remove any grease they may have.
            </li>
            <li>Place the egg whites and cream of tartar or lemon juice in your bowl and whisk at high speed until stiff
                peaks form.</li>
        <li>Now, start adding the white sugar one tablespoon at a time while you're still whisking. Once it's
            incorporated, touch the mixture with your fingers to see if you feel any sugar granules. If so, keep
            whisking until the mixture is smooth and shiny. Now, add the vanilla extract and mix until it's well
            incorporated.</li>
        <li>Cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Place a small amount of the meringue on the underside of each
            corner of the parchment paper to anchor it to the cookie sheet. Using a couple of spoons or a pastry bag,
            shape the meringues on the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Bake for 1½ hour. Then, turn off your oven and leave the door cracked open to let the meringues dry and cool
            down for a few hours before serving. They can be stored in an airtight container.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For the Merengón itself</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven at 250ºF (120ºC).</li>
            <li>Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper and draw medium sized circles (2-3 inches, approx. 5-7.5 cm in
                diameter) on the parchment paper with the help of a cup or small bowl. Turn the parchment paper over so the
                circles are on the underside.</li>
                <li>Prepare the meringue mixture according to the recipe and fill a pastry bag with the tip of your choice (ex.:
                    Wilton 1M star tip) with this mixture. Place a small amount of the meringue on the underside of each corner
                    of the parchment paper to anchor it to the cookie sheet. Shape the meringues by filling out each drawn
                    circle with the mixture giving them a cupcake like shape.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 1½ hour. Then, turn off your oven and leave the door cracked open for a few hours to let the meringues dry and cool down. (If you want completely crispy meringues, let them dry inside the oven without opening the door).</li>
                    <li>Once they are cool, crumble the top of one of the meringues, fill it with whipped cream and place the fruit of your choice on top. If you want to make a two layer merengón, place another meringue on top of the decorated one, crumble it on top as well, fill it with whipped cream and finish it off with more fruit.</li>
    </ol>
