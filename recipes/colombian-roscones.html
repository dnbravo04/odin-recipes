    <h1>Roscones</h1>
    <img src="https://elcalderoerrante.github.io/recetas_img/Roscones.jpg" alt="" style="width: 35%;">
    <p>One of the most popular biscuits in Colombia are roscones, a delicious brioche-styled bread wrapping the delicate
        flavor of a guava paste called <em>Bocadillo</em> or an special caramel called <em>Arequipe</em>.</p>
    <p>In this occasion we're gonna focus in the <strong>Roscones con Bocadillo</strong> recipe because those are the
        most
        common in the Colombian bread stores and cafés</p>
    <h2>Ingredients for 5 servings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of whole milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of salt</li>
        <li>3 tsp of instant yeast</li>
        <p>and for the filling</p>
        <li>1/2 cup of guava paste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat milk in the microwave or on the stove top to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place warm milk, egg, butter, flour, white sugar, icing sugar, salt, and yeast in a bread machine in the
            order listed. Run Dough cycle. Remove dough from the machine after the cycle is done, about 90 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 4 or 5 equal parts depending on the size of the roscones you want to make. Take one
            piece of dough and roll it into a roll about 1/2 inch wide. Repeat with remaining dough. Flatten the rolls
            and fill evenly with guava paste.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough once again so the filling is in the middle and not seen from the outside. Take both ends and
            paste them together, forming a circle with a hole in the middle (like a doughnut). Place in an oiled baking
            pan, leaving room to grow. With a sharp, non-serrated knife, make some slits on the top just deep enough
            that you can see a bit of the filling.</li>
        <li>Once all your roscones are done, cover and let rest until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Brush beaten eggs over each roscón and sprinkle coarse sugar on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack before serving.</li>
    </ol>
